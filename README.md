Cats with Cash
==============

Cats with cash is the dashboard to a CRM used by a philantropic fund raising group. 


It was hastely built, and there are javascript improvements that can be made. 


Starting at commit 9e6ecbdf50 refactor the code. The three techniques covered are implimenting DOM caching(2e86362cee), using event delegation instead of direct binding events(16fb1044c7), and using the module patern(7fd3d505f3). 


To start refactoring, create a new branch: 
`git checkout 9e6ecbd -b let_us_refactor`
